            <h1 class="text-uppercase text-center">Dr. Jun Xia</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">Dr. Xia received his undergraduate training from the Physics Department at the University of Science and Technology of China from 1999 to 2004. He then moved to the University of Toronto and completed his Ph.D. training in 2010 with Dr. Andreas Mandelis on photothermal imaging. In the same year, he joined Dr. Lihong V. Wang's lab at Washington University in St. Louis as a postdoctoral fellow. There, he concentrated on photoacoustic tomography and invented ring-shaped confocal photoacoustic computed tomography (RC-PACT), a small-animal imaging system that provides high-resolution whole-body images of mice. Dr. Xia has published three book chapters and more than thirty papers in peer-reviewed journals. Dr. Xia is now an Assistant Professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo (University at Buffalo). </p>
