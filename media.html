This non-invasive imaging technique, called photoacoustic tomography, combines light and ultrasound technology. It has the potential to better identify breast cancer and address an unmet clinical need in these patients. The grant is part of $30.7 million for 98 research grants Komen is distributing across the country in the coming year, with a focus on new treatments and understanding of the most lethal forms and stages of breast cancer. Komen funding to institutions in 27 states and 7 countries also includes research into new screening technologies, treatments for metastatic and aggressive types of breast cancer and disparities in breast cancer outcomes.</p><a href="http://wyrk.com/university-at-buffalo-receives-susan-g-komen-450000-national-research-grant/" target="_blank">Read more... </a>

            <p class="text-justify">One of many approaches to studying neurological function involves imaging the brain's functional connectivity, an observational analysis of neuronal activity in different parts of the brain. Recent research suggests that fluctuations in the activity of separate groups of neurons are interactively correlated, although they do not affect one another's activity directly. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) imaging is one technique that is emerging to identify low-frequency, spontaneous cerebral fluctuations in hemodynamics—such as blood oxygenation and total hemoglobin concentration—that are associated with these functional connections. </p><a href="http://spie.org/x106260.xml" target="_blank">Read more...</a>

            <p class="text-justify">Measuring local blood flow inside living creatures provides insight into both normal functions and diseases. Ultrasound can probe deep within tissues by using the Doppler shift of the sound waves’ frequency to detect the motion of blood cells. But this effect is unmeasurable for blood moving slower than about ten millimeters per second. In Physical Review Letters, Lidai Wang and his colleagues at Washington University, Missouri, demonstrate that ultrasonic waves can instead be used to heat a small volume of blood, thereby “tagging” it. The motion of this tagged blood is then tracked by a light-based technique. In a test setup, they measured speeds as low as a quarter of a millimeter per second.</p><a href="http://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.204301" target="_blank">Read more..</a>

            <p class="text-justify">A new method for imaging the flow of blood has been developed by researchers in the US. By using ultrasound to thermally tag blood, along with photoacoustics to image the resulting heat flow, the new technique is considerably more sensitive than the conventional Doppler ultrasound method that is currently used. While presently at the in vitro testing stage, this technique might have a variety of clinical applications, especially in medical diagnosis. Being able to image the flow of blood within deep tissue would provide valuable information for the diagnosis and understanding of many diseases, with potential applications  including functional brain imaging, detection </p><a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/nov/13/thermal-technique-improves-blood-flow-measurements" target="_blank">Read more...</a>

            <p class="text-justify">Now there’s a better way to spy on the blood in your veins. Doctors already have two techniques to monitor obstructions in blood vessels, but they both have limitations. The first, Doppler ultrasound imaging, involves irradiating tissue with ultrasound waves; the waves that reflect off flowing blood acquire a Doppler shift, which can be used to pick out blood and calculate its speed. Doppler can't distinguish flowing blood from surrounding tissue unless it's moving quickly, however, which makes minor blood vessels invisible.

            <p class="text-justify">Optical imaging is beginning to come to age. It has long held great promise as a tool for interrogating surface tissues because of the flexibility in selection of fluorophores. While some information has long been available with the use of a signal from intrinsic contrast with hemoglobin or cytochromes, applications have been limited either to those demanding only very limited spatial information or where the tissue can be exposed. </p><a href="http://f1000.com/prime/718021232" target="_blank">Read more...</a>
